        "# Introduction\n",
        "Text classification is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing.  Given multiple individual spans of texts (sentences, paragraphs, documents, etc.), the task is to assign each span one or multiple labels - or *classes* - out of $k$ possible ones.  Some possible applications of text classification are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Genre identification - Does this text contain news, sports, finance, etc?  \n",
        "* Language detection - Is this text in English, German or any other language?\n",
        "* Sentiment analysis - What type of sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) is present in this text?  Additionally, if multiple subjects or topics are discussed, what sentiment is associated with each such subject/topic? \n",
        "\n",
        "A particular type of text classification is the problem of *authorship attribution*.  In this task we are given some documents and a set of possible authors.  We then assign each document with a set of the authors who we believe wrote the document.  Presumably, we also have a large set of documents for which we know the authors already so we can extract features and characteristics to help us with the unknown ones.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Authorship attribution is a well-studied problem which led to the field of [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry).  As with many other NLP problems, it has benefited greatly from the increase in available computer power, data and advanced machine learning techniques.  All of these make authorship attribution a natural candidate for the use of deep learning (DL).  In particular, we can benefit from DL's ability to automatically extract the relevant features for a specific problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab we will focus on the following:\n",
        "1.  Building a *linguistic style model* to extract author-specific features from a set of texts (known as a *corpus*)\n",
        "2.  Using these features for building a classification model for authorship attribution\n",
        "3.  Applying the model for identifying the author of a set of unknown documents"

        "# The Federalist Papers\n",
        "\n",
        "The [Federalist Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers)[1] are a set of essays written between 1787 and 1788 by [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) and [John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay).  Initially published under the pseudonym 'Publius', their intent was to encourage the ratification of the then-new Constitution of the United States of America.  In later years, a list emerged where the author of each one of the 85 papers was identified.  Nevertheless, for a subset of these papers the author is still in question.  The problem of the Federalist Papers authorship attribution has been a subject of much research in statistical NLP in the past (see the above Wikipedia article for details).   We will try to use Deep Learning to re-create this research.\n",
        "\n",
        "In concrete terms, the problem is identifying - for each one of the disputed papers - whether Alexander Hamilton (AH) or James Madison (JM) are the authors.  We will assume that each paper has a single author (i.e., that no collaboration took place) and that each author has a well-defined writing style that is displayed across all the papers. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "We will take the following approach with this problem:\n",
        "* Use the non-disputed documents as labeled data for an end-to-end model.  The model is composed of two distinct parts (see Figure 1 below):\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  A linguistic  style feature extractor\n",
        "    2.  A classifier\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "* Use the model to determine the author for each disputed paper\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"images/model.png\" style=\"width:500;height:300px;\"> <br>\n",
        "<caption><center> **Figure 1**: Author Attribution Model </center></caption>\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us now examine each model component in turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Style Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a sequence of tokens (subsets of the input text), we would like the extractor to return a representation of this sequence such that sequences with similar stylistic qualities have similar representations.  In other words, we would like to find a mapping from the sequence to a vector space that uses style properties as its basis.  Some possible properties that the extractor may learn include (but are not limited to):\n",
        "* Where, when and how often punctuation is used\n",
        "* Distribution of sentence length\n",
        "* The use of specific vocabulary and syntactic constructions \n",
        "\n",
        "The above features are well-known in stylometry.  We would like, however, for the model to learn both these and other features that may be applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to use sequences we will need models that can deal with time-varying inputs (i.e., multiple timesteps with different inputs at each timestep).  In our case, we will have one token every timestep and a fixed sequence length.  These will be our *hyperparameters* - a set of parameters that we determine empirically and that do not change during the training.  The model itself will be a Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) and specifically, a variant named [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) that is ideally suited for NLP problems (see Figure 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"images/lstm.png\" style=\"width:500;height:300px;\"> <br>\n",
        "<caption><center> **Figure 2**: LSTM Cell </center></caption>\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, our feature extractor will be a type of language model.  That is, given a set of tokens the model can predict the next token with high accuracy.  Let's look at an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> (1)   The cat sat on the X \n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at (1), we can make some assumptions about the token X:\n",
        "* It is likely a noun (or more precisely, a [Noun Phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase)).  Otherwise, (1) may not be a grammatically-correct sentence.\n",
        "* It is likely some piece of furniture.  Otherwise, there would not be agreement with the semantics of the verb *sat*. \n",
        "\n",
        "If we have such a model available - namely, one that predicts sequences that appear in our training data with high probability - the natural conclusion is that is has learned how our authors tend to write and we can then attempt to use that knowledge.  Here we encounter our primary issue:  training language models on words requires potentially millions of examples.  We have a relatively small corpus, so a word language model may severely overfit (in other words, this model may pick up specific patterns that just happen to appear in our corpus).  This is a tough issue - fortunately, in this case it is easy to overcome.  Since our corpus is composed of proper English text (i.e., no foreign characters or emojis) we can simply use *characters* as the tokens and not words.  For example, given the phrase \"to the people of New York\", we will have the sequence:\n",
        "['t', 'o', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'p',...] \n",
        "Note that whitespace and punctuation are also characters and will be part of the sequences.  This will hopefully assist us in learning the features mentioned above.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Another trick we can use is to use character *embeddings* as opposed to just the characters themselves (for instance, in a 1-hot encoded representation). Recall that embeddings are dense representations of data that can learn the semantics of the domain.  Here the terminology may be a bit confusing, but the final result is that the embedding of a single character can represent features about the *context* of the character: which characters tend to appear before and/or after this one.  This is precisely what we need.\n",
        "\n",
        "So the structure of our style feature encoder is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A sequence of characters (length of sequence is a hyperparameter)\n",
        "* An embedding layer for characters (dimensionality of the embedding is a hyperparameter)\n",
        "* LSTM layer for learning a sequence representation (dimensionality of LSTM output is a hyperparameter).  We will use the output of the LSTM at the end of the sequence as our output.  This is known as a *context vector* (or *state vector*) - it encodes details about a particular sequence of characters that can be used by the classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classifier\n",
        "\n",
        "As noted above, the output of the style feature extractor (or *feature encoder*) is a fixed-size vector.  We use this vector as the input to a simple multi-layer feed-forward network.  Each layer in the network can then extract features that help it determine whether the character sequence (that is, the fixed-size *representation*) was written by AH or JM.  The final layer is composed of a single neuron with a [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) activation, so that the entire model's output $y$ is constrained to be $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$.  Hence, the output can be interpreted as the probability that $y = 1$ or equivalently - given that we arbitrarily assigned the value 1 to JM and 0 to AH - that the sequence was written by JM.  This is easily extendable to multiple ($k \\gt 2$) authors by using $k$ neurons in the final layer with a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "A very useful property of the entire model (both the feature encoder and the classifier) is that it can be trained end-to-end - there is no need for specifically building either the feature encoder or classifier.  Furthermore, it also means that we can use this model to easily infer the author of each of the disputed papers.  For each such document, we perform the following procedure:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Break the entire document to sequences of the same length, as determined by the hyperparameter\n",
        "2.  Retrieve an author prediction for each one of these sequences\n",
        "3.  Determine which author has received more 'votes'.  We will then use this author as our prediction for the entire document.  (Note:  in order to have a clear majority, we need to ensure that the number of sequences is odd).\n",

Therefore we used a model that will output one or the other.  More generally, we could have used a model that returns *confidence levels* for each author - we would then have multiple sigmoid outputs, each giving us the probability of the input text having been written by an author.  If no sigmoid exceeds a certain threshold (for example, 0.5), we can declare that text's author as unknown.\n",
